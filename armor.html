    <p> 
In Perfect World your character is protected by armor.  Armor consists of three basic types: 
Arcane Armor, Light Armor, and Heavy Armor. 
    <br><br>
Within each type of armor multiple levels of armor exist.  What level of armor you can use is 
dependent upon your character level and attributes.  
    <br><br>
Each level of armor has multiple pieces, each of which cover different body parts.  
Four pieces directly change the look of your character.  These pieces are: Chest, Arm, Leg, and Boots.  
Helmets and Robes are armor items that do not change the appearance of your character.
    <br><br>
Below are links to each type of armor.
